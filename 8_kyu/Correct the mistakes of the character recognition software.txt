Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.


SOLUTION

function correct(string)
{
  const stringAsArray = string.split("");
  
  for (i = 0; i < stringAsArray.length; i++) {
    if(parseInt(stringAsArray[i]) === 5) {
      stringAsArray[i] = "S"
    } else if(parseInt(stringAsArray[i]) === 0) {
      stringAsArray[i] = "O"
    } else if (parseInt(stringAsArray[i]) === 1) {
      stringAsArray[i] = "I"
    }
  }
  
  return stringAsArray.join("")
}

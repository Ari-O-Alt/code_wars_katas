I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

SOLUTION

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {

  const sumArr1 = arr1.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =>  accumulator + currentValue)
  const sumArr2 = arr2.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =>  accumulator + currentValue)
  
  return sumArr1 + sumArr2;
}

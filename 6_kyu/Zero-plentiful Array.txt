An array is called zero-plentiful if it contains at least one 0 and every sequence of 0s is of length at least 4. Your task is to return the number of zero sequences if the given array is zero-plentiful else 0.

SOLUTION

function zeroPlentiful(arr) {
    // variable holding the number of sequences
    let sequences = 0;
    // variable holding number of consecutive zeros
    let consecutiveZeros = 0;
    // we loop over each array element
    for (let i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++) {
        // it the element is zero, we add it to the sequence
        if (arr[i] === 0) consecutiveZeros++;
        // if the element is not zero
        else {
            // is the sequence's length is bigger than 0 but smaller than 4
            if (consecutiveZeros !== 0 && consecutiveZeros < 4) {
                return 0;
            }
            // if the sequence's length is bigger than 3
            if (consecutiveZeros > 3) {
                sequences++;
            }
          // if the first 2 ifs are not true, reset consecutiveZeros
            consecutiveZeros = 0;
        }
    }
    return sequences;
}
